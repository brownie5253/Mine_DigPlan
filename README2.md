This project uses a numpy array to represent an open pit mine of either 2D (x,z) or 3D (x,y,z) configuration. 
Each cell of these arrays are assigned values which represent the payoff for digging this cell and so a Dynamic algorithm using recursion and a Branch and Bound 
algoritm is run to compute Best payoff, best state and best dig plan.

To run the repository import Main, search and mining and then run Main.py which will generate a random mine and generate an output to the console.
